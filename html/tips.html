                1. Eat more fruits and vegetables
                Fruit and vegetables are good for our health, and most come with a low environmental impact. There are
                exceptions,
                as some require a lot of resources to transport and keep fresh, so eating these less frequently can
                increase
                the
                sustainability of our diets. Examples include:

                fruits and vegetables that are fragile, or require refrigeration (salads and berries)
                vegetables that are grown in protected conditions (such as hot-house tomatoes or cucumbers)
                foods that use a lot of resources during transport (green beans, mange-touts, or berries imported from
                the
                southern
                hemisphere).
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Eat locally, when in season
                Locally-grown foods can be a sustainable choice, if we choose those that are in season where we live.
                The
                cost of
                producing or storing local foods beyond their natural growing seasons could be higher than shipping
                foods
                that are
                in season somewhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Avoid eating more than needed, especially treats
                Consuming only what we need reduces demands on our food supply by decreasing excess production. It also
                helps to
                keep us healthy and avoid excessive weight gain. Limiting snacking on energy-dense low-nutrient foods
                and
                paying
                attention to portion sizes are all useful ways to avoid unnecessary overconsumption.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Swap animal proteins for plant-based ones
                In general, more resources are needed to produce animal-based proteins (especially beef), compared to
                plant-based
                proteins (such as beans, pulses and some grains). Eating a more plant-based diet also brings health
                benefits:
                plant-based food provides more fibre, and has a lower saturated fat content, both of which can
                contribute to
                a
                decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.

                For meat-eaters, limiting meat consumption to 1-2 times a week, having meat-free days and choosing more
                sustainable
                meats like chicken over beef can help us reduce our ecological footprint.
                For those choosing a vegan/vegetarian diet, combining different sources of plant-based protein will
                ensure
                our
                protein needs are met.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Choose whole grains
                Non-refined cereals are generally less resource intensive to produce than refined ones as they require
                fewer
                processing steps. They are also good for health, reducing our risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2
                diabetes, and
                overweight.

                Whole meal bread, whole grain pasta, unrefined barley, buckwheat and quinoa, are great choices.
                Brown rice is a good substitute for white rice, but it should be enjoyed in moderation, as a lot of
                water is
                used
                during its production.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Choose sustainably sourced seafood
                Fish is a good source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to normal vision, brain function
                and
                heart
                health. However, overfishing is causing wild fish stocks to become depleted. In order to benefit from
                the
                necessary
                nutrients and reduce pressure on wild fish stocks:

                consume fish and seafood 1-2 times weekly to provide the necessary nutrients and reduce pressure on wild
                fish
                stocks.
                choose fish and seafood marked with a sustainability label from certified organisations such as the
                Marine
                Stewardship Council.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Eat dairy products in moderation
                While milk and dairy production has an important environmental impact, dairy products are an important
                source of
                protein, calcium and essential amino acids, and have been linked to reduced risk of several chronic
                diseases,
                including metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, stroke, bowel cancer and type 2 diabetes.

                Enjoy low-fat unsweetened dairy products daily, but in moderation.
                Limit consumption of high-fat cheeses to occasional.
                For those of us who choose to eliminate dairy completely, opt for plant-based drinks that are fortified
                with
                vitamins and minerals, like calcium.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Avoid unnecessary packaging
                Food packaging, especially when made of non-recyclable materials can have a huge impact on the
                environment.
                We all
                can reduce the amount of packaged products we buy (think of bulk apples versus cling-film wrapped ones),
                or
                opt for
                materials that are biodegradable, fully recyclable, or made from recycled materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Drink tap water
                In Europe, the standards of water quality and safety are high. Instead of buying bottled water, we can
                re-fill a
                reusable water bottle at the tap as many times as we want. Tap water costs a fraction of the price of
                bottled water
                and reduces our ecological footprint.
